# Diamonds
This is a coursera assignment project, where the system prints diamond shapes according to size (1-8) provided by user. 

Replace "mOut." with "System.out." in Logic.java class and you're good to go. 
Extensive nesting loops are used to print the diamonds based on the provided size. All thr work is done in "Logic.java" class. 
The current logic of the program can be improved and the code can be made more generic as well.
